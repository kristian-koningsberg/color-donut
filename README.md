# COLOR DONUT - the HEX Generator Tool - html, css, js, three.js (vite)

This is an original app that lets you create colors by rotating the donut and then grab them for use. It is made with html, css, js and three.js.

How to use it:

1. Rotate the donut by clicking and dragging on the screen.
2. When happy with the current color of the donut, click the Grab color button and see it get stored in one of the circles.
3. Clicking any of the colored circles will copy that color as a HEX code to your clipboard. Paste it in wherever you need it for further use.
4. You can create up to 5 colors.
5. After the 5th color made, the button will change its function to reset the circles for a new session of color-grabbing.

Have fun!

Process and thoughts:

This was my very first project exploring three.js.
I have some experience from 3D in blender and that is the main reason why i am also learning three.js now. It is alot of fun, but also hard.
It is challenging to get the delicate syntax correct and also the logic behind how to get things to move etc.
